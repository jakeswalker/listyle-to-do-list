# Listyle: To-Do List & List Organizer
An iOS to-do list application that I designed, programmed, and deployed using Xcode and Objective-C in 2015. It was created to make organizing tasks both fun and easy by using shapes and colors.

This was my first project in software development, during which I learned my first programming language, Objective-C. Through this experience, I discovered the joy of creating things that others use, which ultimately led me to pursue a degree in computer science.

The app received hundreds of downloads globally and was featured by app bloggers.

The project is no longer actively maintained; however, the source code is available upon request.
